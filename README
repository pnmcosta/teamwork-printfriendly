`teamwork-printfriendly` is a Chrome Extension that prints friendly Project Tasks and Task Lists in your [Teamwork Projects](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-software) account.

## Usage

After you install (see below) an extension icon ![teamwork-printfriendly icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnmcosta/teamwork-printfriendly/master/src/icons/icon24.png) will show in the extensions dock.

On any Project Tasks or Task Lists click the button to print the expanded lists/subtasks description(s) and time estimates with unnecessary UI elements hidden.

This extension is not meant to replace the Reports funcionality included in [Teamwork Projects](https://www.teamwork.com/project-management-software) it's just a print friendlier version of project tasks and task lists.
